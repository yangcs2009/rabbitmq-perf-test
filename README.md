## RabbitMQ Performance Testing Tool

This repository contains source code of the [RabbitMQ Performance Testing Tool](https://www.rabbitmq.com/java-tools.html).
The client is maintained by the [RabbitMQ team at Pivotal](http://github.com/rabbitmq/).

## Installation

This is a standalone tool that is distributed in binary form using 
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test/releases)
and a Maven repositry (see below).

## Usage

### Running Performance Tests

Assuming the current directory is the root directory of the binary distribution,
to launch a performance test with 1 producer and 1 consumer:

```
bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest
```

Use

```
bin/runjava com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest --help
```

to see all supported options.


### Producing HTML Output of Runs

The HTML Performance Tools are a set of tools that can help you run 
automated benchmarks by wrapping around the `PerfTest` benchmarking 
framework. You can provide benchmark specs, and the tool will take care
of running the benchmark, collecting results and displaying them in an 
HTML page. Learn more [here](html/README.md).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for an overview of the development process.


## Building from Source

To build the JAR file:

```
mvn clean package
```

Files are then in the `target` directory.

To build the JAR file, source and binary distributions:

```
mvn clean package -P assemblies
```

## Logging

`PerfTest` depends transitively on SLF4J for logging (through RabbitMQ Java Client). `PerfTest` binary distribution
ships with Logback as a SLF4J binding and uses Logback default configuration (printing logs to the console). If
for any reason you need to use a specific Logback configuration file, you can do it this way:

```
bin/runjava -Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/logback.xml com.rabbitmq.perf.PerfTest
```

If you use `PerfTest` as a standalone JAR in your project, please note it doesn't depend on any SLF4J binding,
you can use your favorite one.
